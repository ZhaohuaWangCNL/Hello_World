# Hello_World
Zhaohua's first repository. might use it to store my ideas later on.

I was a geologist with MSc. in Resource Engineering. But I worked as a barista in a cafe.
I do not mind a Starbucks coffee though.

IDEA OF THE DAY
English study: collect TED video ->collect transcript ->compare with the database of say 4000 basic vocabulary and highlight those basic vocabulary in the TED speech  -->explain those words for the learner.
Dutch study: using TED speech in Dutch
